# importing turtle allows us to use code that we didnt write to excute the code we
# are going to write. This code lives else where and 'import' allows our code to
# call that code 
import turtle

# Turtle with a capitol T is a Constructor function that will create us a
# 'turtle object'
# Then we can 'assign' that turtle we created to the variable called parent
parent = turtle.Turtle()
# we do the same thing for this turtle we created and called 'kid'
kid = turtle.Turtle()
# using a variable allows us to store some information in memeory that we can access
# later in this case we are going to want to use our new turtles called parent and kid

# using our kid turtle we can use the '.' or dot operator to access a method
# called 'shape' which gives our kid the shape of a turtle
kid.shape('turtle')
